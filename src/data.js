        description: "Dedicated to who I am before turning 20. The work is a combination of the two things I love most: art and engineering. The support structure as well as the custom shaped main panel were all constructed by hand using scrap materials. The shape of the main panel is derived from an aerial view of Le Corbusier's Carpenter Center. Being his only work in North America and located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, this building has a special place in my heart as it is my favorite building to frequent. In the center sits a self portrait. Behind this are waves of lines signifying the beautiful yet tumultuous nature of human relations. Based on instructions from Sol Lewitt modified to my own liking, I drew a line, then had a friend draw a line. If one of us lifted the marker or ran into another line a red cross was placed.I have a strange obsession with cranes. The two side panels are abstracted views of my custom motorcycle. Motorcycles are the reason I fell in love with engineering in the first place and showed me what beautiful engineering and design can produce. The colors are muted representations of the two cities most important to me at the time: Los Angeles and Boston.",
